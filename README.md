# Elijah's UX Portfolio

My name is Elijah Beverley, and I’m currently in my third semester at Chico State studying Computer Sceince. I transferred from Saint Mary’s College of California, where I played soccer, and finised my collegiate career here at Chico State. My career aspirations are in Data Science and Analytics. I enjoy reading, watching anime, and collecting trading cards.
